# MILESTONE 1 : Create basic RESTful APIs
## How to excute?

1. Download the zip file from this repository, and go to the `assignment1` folder.
2. In there, type this:
   ```bash
   docker build -t (your custom name) . 
   ```
   > DON'T FORGET THE DOT AT THE END!!
3. Wait until the build ends.
4. After the build ended, type this:
   ```bash
   docker run -it (your custom name)
   ```
5. If it runs succesfully, then this command line should appear.
   ```
   root@(containerId):~/project#
   ```
6. Enter `sh run.sh` or `bash run.sh` and wait until you see this:
   ```
    part2 Database has been loaded.
   ```
   or this.
   ```
   Movies Database has been loaded.
   ```
   > This takes at least 50 seconds. Wait until all the database loaded. If you call any API before this done, nothing would work.
7. Open another terminal and type this:
   ```
   docker exec -it (your custom name) /bin/bash
   ```
8. And now you can use `curl`.
